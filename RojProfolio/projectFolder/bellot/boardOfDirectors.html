          <p>Born on the small island of Latoti, off the northern coast of Haiti, Antoine Bellot grew up in a rural Haitian community. The youngest of 20 children, he left his small island at age 15. After finishing High School, he boarded a small boat and began a long journey, to the Bahamas, then to Florida, and finally to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he has spent the last 30 years. Antoine attended City College of San Francisco, and has held many occupations, from construction, to customer service. He currently works for Orowheat, dedicating the rest of his time to Bellot Idovia Foundation. Antoine has a gift of organizing and working with people, and is committed to using that gift to give back to the people in his village in Latoti. Antoine Bellot strongly believes that everyone has a human right to basic needs, and will do everything he can to help the people of Latoti achieve independence and sustainability. His parents, Louissaime Bellot and Idovia Cadet believed that if one member of the community suffers, we all suffer. Through Bellot Idovia Foundation Antoine strives to honor that belief and continue its legacy. Antoine is fluent in Haitian Kreyol, and English.</p>
