<h1><b>Access to Clean Water in Haiti <b/><br> <br></h1>
<p> <small>“The rock in the water does not know the pain of the rock in the sun.” -Haitian Proverb</small><p/>

<p>Access to clean, safe drinking water is of vital importance to any community.

Communities without this vital resource know especially well.

 
<hr>
<p>Can you imagine having to purchase unsafe, untreated water as your primary source of drinking water for you and your family? Many in Haiti have no other choice, and few have access to public wells and springs. They must buy water that makes them sick–or go without. Waterborne diseases account for more than half of the illnesses in the country, and to date, more than 700,000 got ill and 9,000 have died of Cholera since the deadly outbreak in 2010.<br>

Ile de La Tortue, or Latoti, is a small island off the northern coast of the Haitian mainland. It is home to over 60,000 people, most of whom have no access to a clean, safe water supply. Many of the island’s children spend the day collecting water from far away sources, instead of attending school. To make matters worse, the water the children are collecting makes them sick.<br>

In 2010 Bellot Idovia Foundation initiated the Community Water Project, with the mission to work with the local community to develop and maintain permanent, safe water supplies. The project is divided into three phases, giving us the opportunity to address the immediate needs of the community while planning a long-term solution at a grassroots level.</p>
<hr>

 <h2>Phase 1</h2><p>

Address immediate health risks by distributing water filters.
Educate the community about clean water and the risks of unsafe water via workshops and classes.
Survey existing well sites and test well water.
Develop plans to retrofit an existing well site.
For more info on Phase 1 of our Community Water Project, click here!</p>
<hr>

<h2>Phase 2</h2>
<p>    Develop well sites according to plans, covering and protecting open well sites with the help of members of the local community.
Educate members of the community about maintenance of wells, and development of well sites via classes and training courses.
Develop plans in cooperation with the local community regarding future plans to distribute water to communities directly
For more info on Phase 2 of our Community Water Project, click here!
<hr>
 <h2>Phase 3 </h2><p>

Establish water containment structure in rural communities.
Seal wells and install electric pumps powered by solar or wind energy.
Establish a pipeline delivering water from well sites to rural communities.</p>

      <h1><b>Island Reforestation Project<b/><br></h1>
    <p>
Most of Latoti’s trees have disappeared over the last 50 years, due to a recent upswing in charcoal production and export from the island. Essentially, people looking for a relatively quick buck head to the forest, and dismantle a tree–stripping it of most of it’s branches, usually using a rope and one’s own body weight. This wood is then gathered into a pile, covered with dirt and stones, and set afire. It is allowed to smoulder for several days, until the moisture and sap is burned from the wood, leaving charcoal. This is loaded on a boat and taken across the water to mainland Haiti, and sold at market. Charcoal is in turn brought back to Latoti, and sold in the marketplace. The charcoal trade not only robs the forest of trees, it robs the community from making even that money from its forest.<br>

An island that was once so lush it was considered an ideal sanctuary for the Caribbean’s most famous pirates is now mostly barren of trees, making it hot, and dry. Much of the mangrove forests have disappeared, and now the land’s precious topsoil is blown away and carried to the sea during heavy rains.<br>

Our Island Reforestation Project currently focuses on supporting individuals and organizations residing on the island, by providing them with supplies and training materials. Reclaiming an eroded landscape is a long, painstaking process, and cannot be done from afar, with a few visits per year. We are currently working very closely with Aurelier Aurelier, and his brother Pirerre Aurelier, who have formed a small organization which focuses on planting vetiver and other vegetation on the slopes on southwest Latoti. They are also investigating sustainable, low-cost farming techniques, including hillside agriculture.<p/>

          <h3>PUBLIC TOILETS</h3>
          <p>Many common community areas, particularly those close to the shoreline, are without toilets, resulting in water contamination from human waste. In 2008, Bellot Idovia funded and facilitated the building of 3 public toilets in the town of Lavalle on La Toti. Similar projects in surrounding towns are in the planning stage. We will also be collaborating with S.O.I.L. to build sustainable composting toilets in the near future.</p>

          <h3>BUILDING HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
          <p>Since 2007, Bellot Idovia has been coordinating with local nurses and doctors to upgrade the community clinic and make health care more accessible. Over the past few years, we have repainted the clinic, put in new windows and doors, installed a generator, and brought 3 separate shipments of sorely needed medications.</p>

          <h3>LA PWOPTE BEL   (“Cleanliness is Beautiful”)</h3>
          <p>In 2008, we organized, supplied, and facilitated a twice-weekly community clean-up crew called La Pwopte Bel. Focusing on the coastal areas, this large group of young residents continues to clean and maintain La Toti, while spreading the message that “Cleanliness is Beautiful.” We are expanding this program town by town around the island.</p>

          <h3>SUSTAINABLE ENERGY: SOLAR</h3>
          <p>In November of 2009, we helped the people of La Toti install solar panels on the community clinic and public toilets. Solar expert Bruce Gardiner went to La Toti with BIF members and showed local residents how to install and maintain solar panels, beginning the local development of renewable power.</p>
